Linear Regression Assignment
# Problem Statement
A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic.
The company wants to know:

Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
How well those variables describe the bike demands
# Business Goal:
I will create a model for demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market. 
The model should be built taking this 'cnt' as the target variable from the data provided.
# Model Evaluation:
 Calculate the R-squared score on the test set.
## Conclude with a best possible suggestion for the company to make it profitable
